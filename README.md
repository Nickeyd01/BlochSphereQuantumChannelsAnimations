# BlochSphereQuantumChannelsAnimations

This repository contains the implementation of a Mathematica Script allowing to plot the effect of different quantum channels (Amplitude Damping, Phase Damping and Depolarization) on a Bloch Sphere.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nickeyd01/BlochSphereQuantumChannelsAnimations.git
```
## Extension

An extension to python using Qiskit, will be provided soon.
